* Conceptual model and set of communcations protocols used in the Internet and other networks
* Known as TCP/IP because those are two of the foundational protocols in the suite
* Developed by the United States Department of Defense through DARPA (Defense advanced Research Projects Agency)
* Similar structure to the OSI model, but with fewer layers
* This is the model actually in use in modern networks

## OSI vs TCP/IP

Whenever people talk about the layers, they are usually talking about the layers in the OSI model. Even if we do use TCP/IP Suite in modern networks, we mostly refer to the layers in the OSI model when talking about networks.

The diagram below demonstrates the process of a host, Host A sendind data to Host B with two routers in between.
